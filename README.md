<ins>Thoughts On Tech Stack</ins>
<br>
<br>
Since React is my favorite front end framework/library,
I had no doubts that I was going to use it for my degree project.<br>
The question is - JavaScript or TypeScript? For me, I will choose
TypeScript everytime!<br>
This is the first time I actually ever used Tailwind for my styling,
I found it was quite easy to both learn and use.<br> Will definitely not
be the last time.<br>
Vite as bundler and jest for testing works painless everytime!
